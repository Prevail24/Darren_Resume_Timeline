          <p>This has been my most challenging endeavor to date.

Some of my duties included; design of company logos, store design, business and marketing plans, advertising, general labor including construction, design and layout of store and creating a buying, selling and inventory processes. I was in charge of the opening of our second location. IÔ∏è helped expand our company to four successful locations by 2015.

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"> 2011: My Kids Closet</i></h3>
          <p>In 2011 we decided to expand our market and open a kids store that targeted children from newborn to 14 years of age. We went thru a slight rebrand and opened another store with the same business model with major changes being the creation of a whole new database. We successfully opened our first 'My Kids Closet' on March 18th, 2011 in the Southlands Mall.</p>

          <p>In 2017 I saw an opportunity with the Bitcoin / cryptocurrency bubble and the huge rush of inexperienced traders to the cryptocurrency markets.
